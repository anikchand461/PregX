Quick guide — common medicines and the conditions they’re used for (with how they work, major side-effects and key warnings)

⸻

1) Pain & fever — Paracetamol (acetaminophen), NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen), aspirin, opioids
	•	Paracetamol (acetaminophen) — used for mild–moderate pain (headache, toothache, period pain) and fevers. It reduces pain and temperature centrally; it’s generally safe when used at recommended doses but can cause liver damage if overdosed and should be used cautiously with alcohol or known liver disease.  ￼
	•	NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) — reduce pain, fever and inflammation (sprains, arthritis, some menstrual pain) by blocking prostaglandin-producing enzymes (COX). They can upset the stomach, increase bleeding risk, worsen high blood pressure, and harm kidneys — avoid or use cautiously in people with peptic ulcers, heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension or poor kidney function.  ￼ ￼
	•	Aspirin — at typical analgesic doses relieves pain/fever; at low dose (e.g., 75 mg) used as an antiplatelet to reduce risk of heart attack/stroke in some people. Main risks: gastrointestinal bleeding and increased bleeding tendency — don’t start low-dose aspirin for prevention without medical advice.  ￼
	•	Opioids (morphine, codeine, tramadol, etc.) — used for moderate–severe pain (post-operative, cancer pain). Very effective but carry risks: sedation, constipation, respiratory depression, dependence/tolerance and overdose. They are normally reserved for more severe pain and must be used under close medical supervision.  ￼

2) Infections — Antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals
	•	Antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, cephalexin, azithromycin) treat bacterial infections (some ear, throat, chest infections, urinary infections, skin infections). They do not help viral illnesses (most colds/flu). Overuse drives antibiotic resistance — take only when prescribed and complete the course as instructed. Common adverse effects: gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions.  ￼
	•	Antivirals (e.g., aciclovir for herpes, oseltamivir for influenza) — used for specific viral infections and are not broad cures for all viruses; effectiveness depends on early use and the correct drug for the virus.  ￼
	•	Antifungals (e.g., fluconazole, topical azoles) — treat fungal infections of skin, nails, mucosa or systemic fungal disease; route (topical vs oral) depends on severity and location. (Stewardship and accurate diagnosis are important for all anti-infectives.)  ￼

3) High blood pressure & heart conditions — ACE inhibitors (lisinopril, ramipril), ARBs (losartan), beta-blockers (metoprolol), calcium-channel blockers (amlodipine), diuretics
	•	ACE inhibitors / ARBs — lower blood pressure, treat heart failure and protect kidneys (especially in diabetes) by blocking the renin-angiotensin system. Common side effects: dizziness, raised potassium, and (ACEIs specifically) a dry cough; contraindicated in pregnancy. Regular kidney function and potassium checks are required.  ￼ ￼
	•	Beta-blockers (metoprolol, propranolol) — slow heart rate and reduce blood pressure; used for hypertension, angina, some arrhythmias and after heart attacks. Don’t stop abruptly (risk of rebound) and use cautiously in asthma/COPD (some agents) and diabetes.  ￼ ￼
	•	Calcium-channel blockers (amlodipine) — relax and widen blood vessels to lower blood pressure and relieve angina; side effects can include ankle swelling and headache.  ￼

4) Blood-thinning & clot prevention — Antiplatelets (aspirin, clopidogrel) and anticoagulants (warfarin, DOACs: apixaban, rivaroxaban)
	•	Antiplatelets (aspirin, clopidogrel) are used to prevent arterial clots (after heart attack, stent placement, some strokes). They reduce clotting but increase bleeding risk.  ￼ ￼
	•	Anticoagulants (warfarin, DOACs such as apixaban) prevent and treat venous clots (DVT/PE), and reduce stroke risk in atrial fibrillation. Warfarin requires blood monitoring (INR); DOACs are easier to use but still increase bleeding risk and have specific stopping/interaction rules. Always follow exact dosing and monitoring instructions.  ￼

⸻

5) High cholesterol — Statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin)
	•	Lower LDL cholesterol to reduce heart attack/stroke risk. Well-studied and generally well tolerated; main concerns are muscle aches and rare liver enzyme elevations — liver tests and discussion about muscle symptoms are routine. Statins are cornerstone drugs for cardiovascular prevention when indicated.  ￼

⸻

6) Diabetes — Metformin, sulfonylureas, insulin, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists
	•	Metformin (first-line for type 2 diabetes) lowers glucose by reducing hepatic glucose production and improving insulin sensitivity; weight-neutral and low risk of hypoglycaemia but avoid in severe renal failure and with some procedures.  ￼
	•	Sulfonylureas (e.g., glimepiride) increase insulin release — effective but can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) and weight gain.  ￼
	•	Insulin — required for type 1 diabetes and for many people with advanced type 2 diabetes; various formulations (rapid, long-acting). The main acute risk is hypoglycaemia; dosing must be individualized and taught by professionals.  ￼
	•	SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) — lower blood glucose by causing urinary glucose loss; also have proven heart- and kidney-protection benefits in many patients. Watch for genital infections, dehydration and “sick-day” guidance (may need temporary stopping).  ￼ ￼
	•	GLP-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide) — stimulate insulin secretion, slow gastric emptying and reduce appetite; used for type 2 diabetes and, at certain doses, for weight management. They can cause nausea and require specialist oversight; avoid off-label use without guidance.  ￼ ￼

7) Respiratory (asthma/COPD) — Reliever inhalers (salbutamol), preventer inhalers (inhaled corticosteroids like budesonide, beclometasone), LABA/LAMA combos
	•	Short-acting beta-agonists (salbutamol/albuterol) — quick relief (“rescue”) of bronchospasm during an asthma attack. Not for daily control.  ￼
	•	Inhaled corticosteroids (budesonide, beclometasone) — reduce airway inflammation and are the mainstay “preventer” treatments for asthma; must be used regularly for effect and do not relieve an acute attack immediately.  ￼
	•	Combination inhalers / long-acting bronchodilators (LABA/LAMA) are used for long-term control in more persistent asthma or COPD under specialist direction. Always ensure correct inhaler technique and device choice.  ￼

⸻

8) Gastrointestinal — PPIs (omeprazole), H2 blockers (famotidine), antacids, antiemetics (ondansetron, metoclopramide), laxatives
	•	Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole) — reduce stomach acid and are used for reflux, peptic ulcers, and to protect the stomach when taking NSAIDs. They are effective but long-term use has trade-offs (e.g., nutrient absorption issues, infections); use lowest effective dose.  ￼
	•	Antiemetics: ondansetron is widely used for chemotherapy/post-op nausea; metoclopramide is used for some types of nausea and gastroparesis but has time-limited use due to movement-related side effects.  ￼
	•	Laxatives — multiple types (bulk, osmotic, stimulant, stool softeners) to treat constipation; choose the type based on cause and patient factors.  ￼ ￼

⸻

9) Mental health & neurology — Antidepressants (SSRIs), antipsychotics, anxiolytics (benzodiazepines), anticonvulsants
	•	SSRIs (sertraline, fluoxetine) — first-line for many depressive and anxiety disorders; take weeks to work, and monitoring for increased suicidal thoughts in young people is required early after starting. Common side effects: sexual dysfunction, nausea, sleep changes.  ￼
	•	Antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine) — treat psychosis and some mood disorders; associated with metabolic side effects (weight gain, diabetes risk) and require monitoring.  ￼
	•	Benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam) — effective short-term for acute anxiety or severe agitation and for seizures, but risk dependence; generally prescribed for short durations.  ￼
	•	Anticonvulsants (levetiracetam, valproate) — used to prevent seizures; valproate is effective but strongly contraindicated in pregnancy due to high risk of birth defects and developmental problems — strict pregnancy-prevention rules exist.  ￼

⸻

10) Inflammation & immune suppression — Corticosteroids (prednisolone), DMARDs (methotrexate)
	•	Oral/systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone/prednisone) — powerful anti-inflammatories used for severe asthma flares, autoimmune flares, and many inflammatory diseases. Very effective short-term but long-term use causes weight gain, high blood sugar, osteoporosis, mood changes and adrenal suppression — tapering under medical supervision is important.  ￼
	•	Disease-modifying agents (methotrexate, biologics) — used to treat chronic autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis); require specialist monitoring (blood tests, infection screening).  ￼

⸻

11) Skin & topical treatments
	•	Topical steroids for eczema/dermatitis inflammation; antifungal creams for tinea/candidiasis; topical antibiotics (mupirocin) for localized skin infections — choice depends on diagnosis, area treated and patient factors (e.g., children, face, pregnancy). Long-term topical steroid overuse can thin skin and cause local side effects.  ￼ ￼


12) Vaccines — preventive “medicine”
	•	Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize specific pathogens and are among the most effective public-health tools (childhood vaccines, seasonal influenza, COVID-19, etc.). They prevent disease, complications and community spread — recommended schedules vary by country/age and condition.  ￼ ￼



A few important practical rules (short)
	1.	Don’t take antibiotics unless prescribed — antibiotic resistance is a public-health problem; only take them when a clinician says they’re necessary.  ￼ ￼
	2.	Check interactions & special risks (pregnancy, breastfeeding, liver/kidney disease, elderly). Many drugs need dose adjustment or are contraindicated in pregnancy (e.g., ACE inhibitors, valproate).  ￼
	3.	Read the patient leaflet and ask your pharmacist or doctor about side-effects, what to monitor, and when to stop.
	4.	For new or severe symptoms (chest pain, severe bleeding, breathing difficulty or suspected overdose) — go to emergency care immediately.
