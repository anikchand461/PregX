Planning for Pregnancy: What to Know

Introduction:
There are steps you can take before and between pregnancies to increase the chances of having a healthy pregnancy. Planning for pregnancy helps you prepare your body and mind for yourself and your future child.

1. Talk to Your Healthcare Provider

Discuss your health history and any current medical conditions.

Share all medications, supplements, and vitamins you are taking.

Review vaccinations and lifestyle habits.

2. Take 400 micrograms of Folic Acid Daily

Folic acid is a B vitamin that helps prevent neural tube defects in the developing baby.

Start at least 1 month before pregnancy and continue during pregnancy.

3. Avoid Alcohol, Smoking, and Certain Drugs

These can cause premature birth, birth defects, or infant death.

Seek help if unable to stop using substances.

4. Avoid Toxic Substances and Contaminants

Avoid chemicals, metals, fertilizers, bug sprays, and animal feces.

These can affect reproductive health.

5. Maintain a Healthy Weight

Being underweight or overweight increases pregnancy complications.

6. Learn Your Family History

Gather health history to identify risks for you or your baby.

Consider genetic counseling if you have prior pregnancy issues or genetic conditions.

7. Take Care of Your Mental Health

Mental well-being is important for coping with life and pregnancy.

Seek help if stress, anxiety, or depression interferes with daily life.

Resources:

MyHealthFinder Tool for screening tests and vaccines.

Pregnancy Planner PDF to set goals before pregnancy.

Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services locator for treatment programs.

Alcoholics Anonymous programs for support with drinking problems.

1. Nausea

Feeling nauseous at work is common, not just in the morning.

To alleviate nausea:

Avoid triggers that upset your stomach.

Snack often with bland foods, like crackers.

Keep a small stash of easy-to-eat snacks at your desk.

2. Fatigue

Pregnancy increases your body’s energy demands, which may cause tiredness.

Tips to improve energy:

Eat iron- and protein-rich foods: red meat, poultry, leafy greens, iron-fortified cereals, beans.

Take short breaks: get up and move around to reinvigorate yourself.

Stay hydrated: sip water throughout the day.

Reduce workload when possible: scale back tasks to allow more rest.

Maintain fitness: prenatal exercise or walking (as approved by your healthcare provider).

Get sufficient sleep: aim for 7–9 hours per night; resting on your left side maximizes blood flow to your baby. Pillows between your legs and under your belly can add comfort.

3. Movement and Stress Management

Everyday activities like sitting or standing may become uncomfortable as pregnancy progresses.

Tips to ease discomfort and reduce stress:

Move around every few hours to reduce muscle tension and fluid buildup in legs and feet.

Manage work stress: share frustrations with supportive colleagues, prioritize tasks, make daily to-do lists, and practice relaxation techniques.

4. When to Seek Help

If work duties cause concern about your pregnancy, discuss them with your healthcare professional.
